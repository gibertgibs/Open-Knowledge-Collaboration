# Open-Knowledge-Collaboration

Yeah, I can do it
The fear deep inside my heart
Toments my courage,
Fellas programing, fellas upgrading
Technology shooting the sky
Open Tech Collaboration empowering my innermost soul
To face my fears of thinking I can't
I'm no more a pessimist
I'm the change
I'm the technology itself.

A day with a skill is never a time wasted
Girls and boys lighting up their IQ's 
Piercing the healing wounds of pessimistic minds
Dragging them to technology
My idea, their idea, Our idea
For the good of our community

We arise with unique quitors of technology
Lifting the strength of our communities,
The Arduino, Giving us hope of exploration;
The automated Solar charge, lighting our path of technology,
r0g-Agencies the true heaven sent empowerers,
Giving hope to the hopeless through Technology.

I believed I couldn't do it,
I felt I couldn't do it,
They believed I could do it better,
Technology got my back like it were my father,
By its true definition,
Technology is Rogue,
We are Technology.
...........To be continued.
