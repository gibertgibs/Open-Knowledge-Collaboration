Trauma breaks mine heart
The suffering of mine people shutters me
The demolition of the Great motherland sharply instills pain in mine heart,
The harmony; The love; The blessings of our for fathers devoured and turned into the hatred; the segregation and tribalism by a twist inflicting crisis.

How long shall we remain Refugees?
When shall we feel the peace of our fatherland?
Broken is mine heart,
I'm torn between tolerance to pain and acceptance to death,
Dear fellow South Sudanese,
I was in quietude merely sweethearted
A cup of poison given to me to set me free in place of a pond of peace,
I was plagued with undue melancholy of the shame of being in quietude,
Let's arise.

My grandparents came into exile as Refugees,
My parents gave birth to me in exile as a Refugee,
For how long should the generation remain I exile as Refugees:
Warib cing wa me ryemo cen man kare acel;
Cause no one is born hating someone,
Together we can change our fatherland South Sudan;
Ma badna anihina, bi geheru beledna Junub Al Sudan,
Let's unite to eradicate tribalism to feel the presence of peace;
Ti yi tomorgi 'borik i togbwo'ja na gebeliya a'nyen yi kurundo 'busan na taling,
Together as a Nation;
Together as South Sudan
Egbwe Kolu a'a 
Bukku panda yiek nhial
Love without discrimination
Happy South Sudan.
